                                <p>Congratulations on your engagement! Our Saint Juliana Parish Staff and Community share in your joy and excitement as you anticipate your wedding day.
                                 You are about to begin a very important part of your life. A Catholic wedding is not merely a social event it is a sacrament in which a man and woman become husband and wife in the presence of God,
                                  the wedding officiant, and your family and friends. We know this is a wonderful and exciting time for you as you have chosen to be married in the Catholic Church. 
                                  Your marriage and the celebration of your wedding are important events for you, your family and for Saint Juliana.
                                   Please remember that you are being asked to focus on faith and the lifelong sacrament you are about to celebrate and live for the rest of your lives.
                                    By being faithful in your love for one another, not only will you help each other on your journey to heaven, but you will also be a sign for the Church of the very love that Christ has for each of us.
                                     Please know of our prayers for you as you begin this new phase in your life. If there is anything that you need, or any questions that you have, please do not hesitate to contact us. May God continue to bless and increase your love for one another.
